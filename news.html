<p>Many of this release's features were inspired by our users!</p>
<p>Exillius suggested the TNT Timer mod. The original mod was created by Sk1er LLC.</p>
<p>Okay. (yes, that's their name!) suggested the account switcher, and the news tab that you are reading now.</p>
<p>EinfxchJakob was the first to suggest addons.</p>
